# IoT-Based-Automated-Rain-Responsive-Clothesline
An automated cloth protection system that detects rain and shifts clothes to a covered area. It includes real-time monitoring, OLED display, Google Sheets logging, and a web page for live data display.
ESP32 Automatic Cloth Protection System
An intelligent IoT solution that automatically protects drying clothes from rain using ESP32, with real-time monitoring and Google Sheets data logging.

üåßÔ∏è Overview
This project creates an automated cloth protection system that monitors weather conditions and mechanically moves clothes to a covered area when rain is detected. The system features real-time monitoring, OLED display feedback, cloud-based data logging through Google Sheets integration, and a frontend web page that displays real-time data from Google Sheets.
‚ú® Features

Automatic Rain Detection: Uses MH-RD rain sensor for precise moisture detection
